04/14 Janice Lee: I merged and deleted the LoginUser and RegisterUser class to the User class. I added a 
                  UserJDBCConnector class (for validating users) and RegisterJDBCConnector class (for inserting user to database). So User class has the SQL functionalities done. 
                  But for addingEvents...still unsure.
