04/14 Janice Lee: I merged and deleted the LoginUser and RegisterUser class to the User class. I added a 
                  UserJDBCConnector class (for validating users) and RegisterJDBCConnector class (for inserting user to database). So User class has the SQL functionalities done. 
                  But for addingEvents...still unsure. 

04/15 Hailey Oh: 4 pages added: login_page.html, signup_page.html, search_page.html, event_info.html (+ shared.css). Design consistent across all pages. 

04/21 Hailey Oh: Modified chatRoom page for design consistency (must download chatRoom.html, chatRoom.css, shared.css).
